This award is for a junior that has helped “over and above” to promote badminton for juniors, encourage them to play and then to play to the best of their ability. This is on a voluntary basis in their own free time.

This year the award went to Melissa Mundy, in particular for her help at tournaments and assistance at junior clubs.

Congratulations Melissa!
