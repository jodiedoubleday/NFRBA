This award is for a junior that has helped “over and above” to promote badminton for juniors, encourage them to play and then to play to the best of their ability. This is on a voluntary basis in their own free time.

** 2017 Winner Georgia Debling **

The award this year has been given to Georgia Debling. She played a major role in organising the UV badminton demonstration – helping with planning, risk assessment, setting up and dismantling. As captain of our second U19 Inter-Regional team Georgia was a tremendous help to the other girls who were both playing in it for the first time against very strong opposition.  (The UV reference relates to a session played in the dark with highlighted racquets and shuttles etc - exciting and hopefully to be repeated).
