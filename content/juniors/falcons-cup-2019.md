This year's event was one of the most successful yet. With 9 teams involved, players aged between 7 and 19 played matches against players from other clubs. In the U19's Group 1 Ajax were the winners; they played well all day with some of the best rallies of the day.  In Group 2, also U19's, Falcons of Faversham won and their group was the most entertaining and quite jolly whilst still competitive. Group 3, for U13's, was won by Herne Bay B team; this group included a high number of under 10's .  We were pleased to see such a great number of future players.
