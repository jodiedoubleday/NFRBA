## Results
This year we were able to field 3 teams: 2 in the U19’s category and 1 in the U15’s.
The teams consisted of...

### NF U19 - A
* Morrison (captain)
* Ethan
* Fern
* Georgina W
* Rachel 
* Tom

### NF U19 - B
* Andrew (captain)
* Georgia D
* Georgia P
* Goldy
* Li
* Oscar

### NF U15 (AKA the “A team Girls")
* Alyssa (captain)
* Abby
* Adam
* Amy
* Anna
* Callum
* Christopher
* Harry

The teams all looked united in their matching polo shirts (once a few were swapped around) and quickly gravitated to the courts to knock up.

The first clash was North Foreland U19’s A versus B. There was not a forgone conclusion as after 2015, the A team were not taking a win for granted. The strength and experience of the A team showed though and they won the tie.

The U19’s NF A beat NF B 7-0, Beat Orpington 5-2 but lost to Tunbridge Wells 5-2. The addition of Rachel and Tom to the A team were worth noting. Rachel soon showed determination and Tom was focused on winning. Ethan, Fern, Morrison and Georgina put on their usual strong performances and got through some tough ties with key wins.

NF B lost to NF A 0-7, Tunbridge Wells 0-7 and Orpington 0-7 but the scores do not show the number that went to three ends or the number that ended 21 -18 or 19. This is a young team, several players are only just 16 so the experience will stand them in good stead. The addition of Goldy and the 2 Georgias undoubtedly strengthened the team. Andrew and Li knew what to expect from having played in 2015 and this showed and helped plan the pairings. Oscar had to move up an age group. All played well and stood up well to the highly experienced opposition. 

The U15’s beat Orpington 5-2, Medway 4-3 but lost 4-3 to Tunbridge Wells finishing 2nd overall and conceding the final game following an injury. One of the games worth noting was a nail biting girls’ doubles that was so close and hard fought, others came to watch from all over the hall. Well done Alyssa and Amy for winning it. The addition of Adam, Anna and Nathan this year make me optimistic for the 2017 team with them in it. 

For the 1st year, 3 of the U19’s represented the area in the senior IR too.
