There are many players who know John Cambell, one of our longest playing men, who has played competitively in Kent since the 1960's. He has been unwell. To our (and his relief) he in now back home and will no doubt be returning to play shortly.

So, for anyone wanting to play badminton in the masters divisions, we can confirm that the game is still as competitive as ever and despite various afflictions over the years, there are still games to play.

Welcome back John.   

This photo from the Kent website shows the county over-70s team from 2015. JC is the distinguished-looking gent - back left.
