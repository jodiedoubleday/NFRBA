Hi folks,
We can’t put it off any longer - we need to start work on the league for next season.

The only rule change at the AGM was that awarding an extra point to each team which was fielded at full strength. An updated set of rules will be issued later and will be on the website.

There was no change at the AGM from the same timetable as last year – that is to aim to issue the new division structure around the time of the late summer Bank Holiday – 26th August. Working back from that we need to know what teams you intend to enter by the middle of the month – 14th August – so please respond by then. You can either edit this form and return it by email or print and use snail mail.

Team fees have been increased - £8.50 for each senior team, £4.50 for juniors. If you reply online then please don’t forget to send the fees separately. You can save the postage by making the payment directly to our bank account (please say if you are doing this and quote your club name as the reference) - ask me for details.

We need to be able to contact clubs during the season, particularly in an emergency such as the need to re-arrange a fixture. Please make sure that where you are not already specifying more than one contact you add another in case of such an emergency. This is important – teams turning up to an empty hall due to a last minutes fixture change isn’t acceptable.

PLEASE NOTE – unless you say otherwise we will assume that your teams will have a similar strength to last season. Any information about team strengths is useful but for any new teams we must have an indication of likely team strengths in terms of the existing divisions. The names of likely players would be very useful as a guide – it would not commit you to using these players. When we are formatting the leagues (in late August) it might be helpful to be able to talk to someone from your club about team strengths or alternative team entries. If the Sec/Match Sec will not be available, then please let us have details of another contact.

The league structures will be considered at a Committee Meeting to be held in late August - these proposals will then be issued to clubs for immediate comment. The final version will be made available at or soon after the Bank Holiday. Copies will be sent out by email, will be posted on the website and may also be obtained from Committee members. Copies of the new club address list will be similarly available. Club Match Secretaries should be prepared to start to arrange fixtures once the final structure has been issued. Last year we had quite a few rearranged fixtures pushing into May due to the earlier bad weather. Please do what you can to get your matches starting early in the season.

Note that the variation in team entries from year to year is bound to interfere with traditional promotion and relegation but we will need very good reasons for failing to promote division winners.

Junior clubs may not get going until the start of the season and Linda will be in touch to discuss team entries and league structure. It would be helpful however if you could return the team form now confirming basic club details so that we can produce a full club list.

You will be aware that the BE affiliation system will be opening soon – you should have had an email about this. We have had confirmation from BE that completely new members will be covered by the insurance for the September/October period.

Kent fees are unchanged - £6.50 for seniors and zero for juniors.
David – NFRBA Secretary
