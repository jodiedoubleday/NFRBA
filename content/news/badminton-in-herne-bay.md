We are working at Kings Road club on restarting our club nights and hope to be able invite players in this area to come along and take advantage of these sessions in Herne Bay.

Nothing is as yet agreed.

We play at the High School in Herne Bay.

At this stage we are just asking anyone interested to contact us (davehbgardner@yahoo.co.uk) so we can get an idea of possible numbers. We will then issue all the details.

As far as we know the only organised badminton sessions available currently in the Herne Bay/Whitstable areas are those provided by the Active Life organisation - details on their website.
