We are working at Kings Road club on restarting our club nights in the next few weeks and would like to invite players in this area to come along and take advantage of these sessions in Herne Bay.

All the COVID restrictions apply so we will be organising people into groups of 6 with prior notification, plenty of sanitising and so on.

We play at the High School in Herne Bay on Thursday evenings from 7.00 to 10.00 - Â£5 per evening.

At this stage we are just asking anyone interested to contact us (davehbgardner@yahoo.co.uk) so we can get an idea of possible numbers. We will then issue all the details.
