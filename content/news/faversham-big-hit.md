![The Badminton Big Hit lands at Faversham. On Tuesday 14th September Faversham Badminton Club held the event and welcomed 12 new visitors to the club. We had a very busy night with 46 players over five courts; it’s great to see the club busy again. Players came back the following week so it’s a great way to recruit new members to the club.](/images/uploads/faversham2109.jpg)
