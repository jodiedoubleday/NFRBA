The initial restrictions introduced by the Government in March meant that we had no option but to cancel all our events. So the league fixtures for the rest of the season were cancelled as were the Kent Inter-Regional in April and our Inter-Club event in May. This is in line with similar actions in other parts of the county.

Our AGM, which would normally be held in June, has been postponed indefinitely.

There have been suggestions that we might be able to finish the remaining fixtures at a later date - that looks less and less likely  but  you never know. 

The tables have been updated to the point when we were forced to shut down - all results have been included.

Some divisions are already sorted - we know who the winners will be â€“ the others we will have to make a decision about later depending on when/if we are allowed to start playing again. 

We will keep you updated on any future relevant developments.

Keep safe.
