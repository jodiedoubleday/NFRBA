It's with great sadness that we have learnt that Roger Williams passed away a few days ago on the 9th July. Even if you haven't known him personally or played against him on court, you will know that he looked after our website for many years and we owe him a great deal. He was just 72 - not a great age these days.

The funeral service will take place on Monday 29th July 2019 at 11.30am, St Maryâ€™s Church, Faversham, followed by Burial at Love Lane Cemetery. Family flowers only please but donations if desired to either Cancer Research UK, Macmillan Cancer Support or Pilgrims Hospice c/o Hogben & Partis Ltd,  37 Stone Street, Faversham, ME13 8PH Tel: 01795 532319.
