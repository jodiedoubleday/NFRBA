title: Club Tournament May 2022 Results

This year we had a full set of 12 squads entering – mostly clubs with two teams.
The competition was split into two sections – each running as a separate event -
with the results being merged into a single order. There was a full day’s badminton -
from 10.00 to 5.30 with the usual positive feedback from the players. As the table shows
the overall winners were Kings A and they received the magnificent Bowness trophy.
Thanks to all the players who took part and their supporters – and, of course, to the
organising team.
