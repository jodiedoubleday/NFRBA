This is just a brief note about the outcome of our AGM and what’s in the air for the coming season.

We welcome Mike Barham and Lee Funnel as new members on the Committee.


All clubs should have received advance notice from Badminton England about changes for next season - mainly fee changes and insurance dates. I am awaiting response from them to a query I have about coverage for new players during September and October.


Our own local team fees have increased as agreed at our AGM - you will see it on the forms to be issued soon.


The proposal to award an extra league point to teams who field a full side in a match was carried - so in most matches the winners will receive 3 points and the losers 1 point. There were no other rule changes.


I will be issuing shortly (around mid-July) the usual documentation asking you what teams you expect to enter in the league next season. We will want the responses by mid-August. Please let me know if you have changed your club contacts so that I can direct future notes to the correct addresses.


Kent are looking for players in the ‘Masters’ bracket (over 35’s) to take part in various forthcoming events - down-load details [here](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/5ab059806ee993f1040c711e3/files/bc134f4b-6f69-40d8-a5cf-941e5350cab0/KENT_MASTERS_RESTRICTED_ENTRY_FORM_2019_PJ.docx)

Enjoy the summer.
