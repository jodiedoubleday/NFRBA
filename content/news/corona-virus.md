The government announced (16th March) that all unnecessary travel should be avoided and that personal; contacts should be kept to a minimum - and other such restrictions.

In the light of that all of our events have now been cancelled. So the league fixtures for the rest of the season are cancelled as is the Kent Inter-Regional in April and our Inter-Club event in May. This is in line with similar actions in other parts of the county.

Our AGM, which would normally be held in June, has been postponed indefinitely.

We will keep you updated on any future relevant developments.
