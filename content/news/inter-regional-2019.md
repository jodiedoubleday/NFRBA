The Inter-Regional events that we organise on behalf of KBL were successful once again with our local teams taking part in all the competitions. Full results are on the [Kent website](http://www.kentbadminton.co.uk/tournaments/tournamentandinterregional.html) but in outline:

Our senior team won Division 1 - congratulations to them - we haven’t managed that for quite some time. We also entered a second team which had some close games in Division 2.

Our juniors performed well against strong opposition, only narrowly missing out on third place out of six in the under-15’s. It was really tough going in the under-19’s.

Thanks to Mike and Linda for running the teams and to all the players who took part.
